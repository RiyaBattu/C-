<h1>To-Do List Application in C++ </h1>

This C++ project is a console-based To-Do List application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. 
The application allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, edit existing tasks, and view all tasks in an organized manner. Each task is assigned a unique ID and a priority level, ensuring that users can manage their workload effectively.

**Key Features:**

[A] Task Management: Add tasks with descriptions and priority levels (1-10). Each task is assigned a unique ID for easy reference.

[B]Task Editing: Edit the description and priority of existing tasks.

[C] Mark as Completed: Easily mark tasks as completed by referencing their unique ID.

[D] View Tasks: View all tasks in a well-formatted list, displaying the task ID, description, priority, and status (Pending/Completed).

[E] Persistent Storage: Tasks are saved to a file (tasks.txt) upon exiting the application and loaded automatically when the application starts, allowing for persistent task management across sessions.

[F] Batch Task Addition: Add multiple tasks at once, streamlining the process of task entry.



**Technical Overview:**

[A] Language: C++

[B] Concepts Used: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), file handling, modular design, input validation, and basic error handling.

[C] Data Storage: Tasks are stored in a vector of Task structs, and saved to a text file for persistence.


This project showcases a deeper understanding of C++ and serves as a practical tool for managing daily tasks. It can be further extended with additional features such as task deadlines, sorting, and categorization.
